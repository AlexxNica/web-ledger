This document outlines a data model and syntax for expressing a
set of ordered events in a decentralized system in way that can be
cryptographically verified. This technology is useful when coordinating
the recording of events, such as financial transactions, transfer of property,
or time-stamped data that must be shared among coordinating parties. A
primary goal of this ledger format is flexibility, allowing the
pluggability of consensus algorithms, data structures for recording
history, and the type of data that can be stored in the ledger.

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
Decentralized systems often need to coordinate information on their
operational state. While the entire state of the system doesn't need to be
shared, the parts that affect the operation of the entire system are important.
At their most basic, a <a>decentralized system</a> can be viewed as a
<a>state machine</a> where events modify the state of the machine
resulting in a new state:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/ds-lifetime.svg" />
    <figcaption>
A decentralized system can be viewed as a state machine where events
transition the machine from one state to the next.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
There may be many different types of events in the system. Some events may
handle system configuration, defining what the system is and isn't allowed
to do. Some events may store data in the system that must be accessible by
the entire system while other events snapshot the state of the system
for performance and auditing purposes. Other events record the consensus of
the system as a whole at a given point in time so that participants in the
system can know that other participants agree with their view of the system.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/ledger-events.svg" />
    <figcaption>
There may be many different types of events that trigger state changes in
a decentralized system.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
Each event may affect the global system state in some way. This means that
the current state is a representation of all the states and events that came
before it.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/system-state.svg" />
    <figcaption>
As the system processes each type of event, its underlying state changes.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
In certain decentralized systems, like financial or healthcare systems,
auditing these states and events is important to ensure that they are
operating in an acceptable way from a regulatory perspective.
Thus a verifiable record of these events and states is an important component
of the system design, but has not been a practical endeavor until recently.
  </p>
  <p>
Due to recent advances in cryptography and decentralized systems design a new
set of technologies called <a>cryptographic ledgers</a> have enabled the
recording of state and events in a ledger where the ledger can be distributed
and independently verified using cryptography. Some of these ledger systems are
<em>trustless</em>, meaning that no trust (other than a trust in mathematics) is
necessary in order to participate in the system. Other ledger systems are
<em>permissioned</em>, meaning that some trust in 3rd parties are required to
ensure the accuracy of the ledger.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/basic-ledger.svg" />
    <figcaption>
A cryptographic ledger is a log of states and events that can be independently
verified using cryptography.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
This specification details an extensible data model and syntax for expressing
cryptographic ledgers. The data model in this specification is designed to
be protocol-agnostic and flexible, supporting pluggability of consensus
algorithms, various data structures for recording history, and enabling a
wide range of data types to be stored in the ledger.

    <h3>How this Document is Organized</h3>

    <p>
This document is organized as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
<a href="#terminology">Section 2: Terminology</a> defines basic terminology
used throughout this document.
      </li>
      <li>
<a href="#data-model">Section 3: The Data Model</a> describes the basic data
model used for the technology.
      </li>
      <li>
<a href="#syntax">Section 4: Syntax</a> describes the suggested
expression syntax for the data model.
      </li>
      <li>
<a href="#operations">Section 5: Ledger Operations</a>
describes how the rules of the ledger
can be set and modified, how content is stored in the ledger, and how
certain parts of the ledger can be optimized.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>


<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn lt="cryptographic ledger|cryptographic ledgers|ledger">cryptographic ledger</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A method of recording changes in a <a>state machine</a> where the
accuracy of the ledger can be mathematically proven to be correct.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="decentralized system|decentralized systems">decentralized system</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A system in which lower level components operate on local information to
accomplish global goals. For example, an ant colony is a decentralized system
as there is no central control determining when food must be collected or
how new tunnels should be excavated.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="state machine|state machines">state machine</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A system that when given a particular input changes from one internal state
to another internal state. For example, a computer system that operates a
light bulb starts with the light state set to off. When an input to turn
the light on is given, the internal computer system state sets the light
state to on, thus illuminating the light bulb.
  </dd>

<section id="data-model">
  <h2>The Data Model</h2>

  <p>
To provide the greatest amount of flexibility, the data model is a graph.
If a formalized data model is desired, RDF may be utilized but is not necessary.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="syntax">
  <h2>The Suggested Syntax</h2>

  <p>
To ensure that the syntax will be easily adopted by developers, and supports
a graph-based data model, it is RECOMMENDED that the implementation syntax is
JSON-LD (or similarly compatible syntax).
Other RDF-compatible syntaxes MAY also be used to express the ledger semantics.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="operations">
  <h2>Ledger Operations</h2>

  <p>
A ledger consists of a series of entries. This section outlines the basic
types of entries that all Web Ledgers support. A particular Web Ledger MAY
contain more than these basic entries.
  </p>

  <section id="configuring">
    <h2>Configuring the Ledger</h2>

    <p>
Operational rules instruct software algorithms which rules should be applied
when processing a particular Web Ledger. The first entry in a Web Ledger is
typically an operational rule entry.
